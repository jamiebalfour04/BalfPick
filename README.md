# BalfPick
BalfPick is a very simple dropdown interface. It does some clever magic to make them look stunning. The JavaScript is 
entirely optional, you could quite easily wrap every `select` element with the appropriate wrapper code.

To enable the JavaScript BalfPick, just run `$(".balfpick").BalfPick();`
